-- This plugin is not designed to be used as a widget
-- It only contains businness logic. This should mainly be used for management of resources and background tasks
-- Much like daemons

-- use the gears api to loop every x seconds and print hello world
local gears = require("gears")

-- booted the hello-world module
print("hello-world module booted")

local i = 0

gears.timer {
    -- print hello world every second
    timeout = 1,
    -- start looping when loaded
    autostart = true,
    -- this function get ran every second
    callback = function ()
      i = i + 1
      print("Hello, world has printed: " ..  i .. " times")
    end
  }
