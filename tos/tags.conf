# If your application is not launching in the correct window you should try to following
# Each application has a class name you can find it by using this command : xprop | grep 'WM_CLASS'
# After launching that tool press on your application to get its name

# tell the style of layout
# By default dwindle is used
# dwindle or 0 = spiral format
# floating or 1 = normal Desktop environment behaviour
# tile or 2 = tiling layout
# fair or 3 = tiling layout with every window has equal size
# magnifier or 4 = tiling layout like fair, but the main window is in the center
# max or 5 = fullscreen layout

#tag_1=max
#tag_2=1
#tag_3=tile
#tag_5=floating
tag_8=floating
