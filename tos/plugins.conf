# Their are 4 cotegories
# notification, module, settings, topbar and settings app
# We will describe each below
# If you want to enable default widgets you need to prefix those with widget.
# Plugins can be added in ~/.config/tde/
# Each plugin must look as followed dir/init.lua
# So each plugin has its own directory and MUST contain a init.lua
# This file will be ran to generate the widget/module
